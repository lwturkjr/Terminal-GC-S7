Please note during Season 7 the rules were different than the current Season 8 Global Comp and any previous Global Comps, Season 7 was the last Global Competition wiht Prize Support. Becuase of that they had a unique rule set, which included granting extra Mobile Points for Each Factory you had. (The Support stationay unit was known as a factory during Season 7). This lead to well almost a completely new game, and heavily impacted how you created your algorithm and the game plan you implemented.
